## Description

You use Zotero and Medium heavily? You would prefer to apply your color coding from Zotero in Mediums Articles to export the notes to Obsidian? 
This tool makes this possible! 

This Python script allow to scrape articles from multiple lists at [Medium.com](https://medium.com/me/lists). 

These scraped articles are saved into a *library.csv*. This library serves as a local database, for every scrape attempt this script checks if there are differences between the library and scraped articles and save this new articles into this library. 

Nonetheless, this web scraper download every article into a PDF. Therefore, this script uses [scribe.rip](https://scribe.rip) (an alternative frontend for Medium articles, to download more beautiful formatted PDFs). For this purpose I use [Percollate](https://github.com/danburzo/percollate), which is a command-line tool, to turn web pages into beautiful PDFs. 

These PDFs are saved into separate folder (for each list) in a download folder which are located in a *downloads* folder.

Lastly, you can add these downloaded PDFs to Zotero to start you note taking and color coding process.
